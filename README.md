# ColorFill
Coloring Book style application.

This application was a part of an algorithm that changes the same adjacent numbers to a desired number. The final challenge was to convert that algorithm into a coloring book style application that utilizes features such as a "Color Fill" where the user clicks on a square and it fills in the surrounding squares to the desired color.

**Challenge Instructions**
Challenge 1
Create an HTML page with a 100 x 100 grid with each square represented as a 10px x 10px square
Create 3 color pickers at the bottom of the screen one for blue, green, and red
Upon clicking a color picker the color picker should be "selected"
With a color picker selected clicking a square within the grid should change the color of that square to the selected color
With a color picker selected shift-clicking a square within the grid should apply the fill algorithm to that square

Challenge 2
Complete 3 or more of the following additional features
Add other colors & expand the grid
Add a random color selector
Add the ability to have a modified fill that only fills the clicked square and immediately adjacent squares
